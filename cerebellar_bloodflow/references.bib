               neuronal activity, metabolism and cerebral blood flow (CBF) to
               map the brain, but the physiological basis of the neuroimaging
               signals is still not well understood. Here we applied a
               pharmacological approach to separate spiking activity, synaptic
               activity, and the accompanying changes in CBF in rat cerebellar
               cortex. We report that tonic synaptic inhibition achieved by
               topical application of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA)
               (muscimol) or GABAB (baclofen) receptor agonists abolished or
               reduced spontaneous Purkinje cell spiking activity without
               affecting basal CBF. The magnitude of CBF responses evoked by
               climbing fiber stimulation decreased gradually over time after
               exposure to muscimol, being more pronounced in the superficial
               than in the deep cortical layers. We provide direct evidence in
               favor of a laminar-specific regulation of CBF in deep cortical
               layers, independent of dilatation of surface vessels. With
               prolonged exposure to muscimol, activity-dependent CBF increments
               disappeared, despite preserved cerebrovascular reactivity to
               adenosine and preserved local field potentials (LFP). This
               dissociation of CBF and LFPs suggests that CBF responses are
               independent of extracellular synaptic currents that generate
               LFPs. Our work implies that neuronal and vascular signals evoked
               by glutamatergic pathways are sensitive to synaptic inhibition,
               and that local mechanisms independent of transmembrane synaptic
               currents adjust flow to synaptic activity in distinct cortical
               layers. Our results provide fundamental insights into the
               functional regulation of blood flow, showing important
               interference of GABAA receptors in translating excitatory input

              activity and field potentials. 2. Stimulation of the monosynaptic

              Purkinje cells, and extracellular field potentials with a
              characteristic profile that indicated contributions from both
              passive and active membrane mechanisms. The concomitant CBF
              increases were reproducible at fairly short intervals, and suggest
              that both synaptic activity and spikes may contribute to increased
              CBF. 3. Stimulation of the disynaptic parallel fibre system
              inhibited the spiking activity in Purkinje cells, while the
              postsynaptic activity increased as indicated by the simultaneously
              recorded field potential. Nevertheless, CBF always increased. The
              inhibition of spike firing activity was partly dependent on
              GABAergic transmission, but may also relate to the intrinsic
              membrane properties of Purkinje cells. 4. The CBF increases evoked
              by parallel or climbing fibre stimulation were highly correlated
              to the sum of neural activities, i.e. the negativity of field
              potentials multiplied by the stimulus frequency. This suggests a
              robust link between extracellular current flow and
              activity-dependent increases in CBF. 5. AMPA receptor blockade
              attenuated CBF increases and field potential amplitudes, while
              NMDA receptor antagonism did not. This is consistent with the idea
              that the CBF responses are of neuronal origin. 6. This study has
              shown that activity-dependent CBF increases evoked by stimulation
              of cerebellar parallel fibres are dependent on synaptic
              excitation, including excitation of inhibitory interneurones,
              whereas the net activity of Purkinje cells, the principal neurones
              of the cerebellar cortex, is unimportant for the vascular
              response. For the climbing fibre system, not only synaptic
              activity but also the generation of complex spikes from Purkinje
              cells contribute to the increases in CBF. The strong correlation
              between CBF and field potential amplitudes suggests that
              extracellular ion fluxes contribute to the coupling of brain

              possibility that NO might be of importance for the increase of
              cerebral blood flow (CBF) associated with activity of the
              well-defined neuronal circuits of the rat cerebellar cortex.
              Laser-Doppler flowmetry was used to measure increases of
              cerebellar blood flow evoked by trains of electrical stimulations
              of the dorsal surface. The evoked increases of CBF were
              frequency-dependent, being larger on than off the parallel fiber
              tracts, suggesting that conduction along parallel fibers and
              synaptic activation of target cells were important for the
              increase of CBF. This was verified experimentally since the evoked
              CBF increases were abolished by tetrodotoxin and reduced by 10 mM
              Mg2+ and selective antagonists for non-N-methyl-D-aspartate
              receptors. The cerebellar cortex contains high levels of NO
              synthase. This raised the possibility that NO was involved in the
              increase of CBF associated with neuronal activation. NO synthase
              inhibition by topical application of NG-nitro-L-arginine
              attenuated the evoked CBF increase by about 50\%. This effect was
              partially reversed by pretreatment with L-arginine, the natural
              substrate for the enzyme, while NG-nitro-D-arginine, the inactive
              enantiomer, had no effect on the evoked CBF increases.
              Simultaneous blockade of non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and NO
              synthase had no further suppressing effect on the blood flow
              increase than either substance alone, suggesting that the
              NO-dependent flow rise was dependent on postsynaptic mechanisms.
              These findings are consistent with the idea that local synthesis
              of NO is involved in the transduction mechanism between neuronal
              activity and increased CBF.",

              are all strongly coupled, although the mechanisms behind the
              coupling remain unclear. One of the key questions is whether or
              not increases in spiking activity in the stimulated neurons are
              sufficient to drive the activity-dependent rises in cerebral blood
              flow (CBF) that form the basis of the signals used in functional
              neuroimaging such as the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD)
              signal. To this end the present study examined the effect of
              enhanced spike activity per se on CBF in rat cerebellar cortex
              under conditions of disinhibition, achieved by blocking GABA(A)
              receptors using either bicuculline or picrotoxin. Purkinje cell
              spiking activity and local field potentials were recorded by glass
              microelectrodes, and laser Doppler flowmetry was used to monitor
              CBF. Disinhibition increased Purkinje cell spiking rate to
              200-300\% of control without incurring any increase in basal CBF.
              This demonstrates that increased spike activity per se is not
              sufficient to affect basal CBF. The neurovascular coupling between
              excitatory synaptic activity and CBF responses evoked by inferior
              olive (climbing fibre) stimulation was preserved during
              disinhibition. Thus, the unchanged basal CBF in the presence of
              the dramatic rise in Purkinje cell spiking rate was not explained
              by impaired synaptic activity-CBF coupling. On the basis of our
              previous and the present studies, we conclude that increased
              spiking activity of principal neurons is neither sufficient nor
              necessary to elicit CBF responses and in turn BOLD signals, and
              that activation-dependent vascular signals reflect excitatory

               However, the functional contribution of the cerebellum within
               these task domains remains unclear because cerebellar activity is
               often studied in isolation. This is problematic, as cerebellar
               fMRI activity may simply reflect the transmission of neocortical
               activity through fixed connections. Here, we present a new
               approach that addresses this problem. Rather than focus on
               task-dependent activity changes in the cerebellum alone, we ask
               if neocortical inputs to the cerebellum are gated in a
               task-dependent manner. We hypothesize that input is upregulated
               when the cerebellum functionally contributes to a task. We first
               validated this approach using a finger movement task, where the
               integrity of the cerebellum has been shown to be essential for
               the coordination of rapid alternating movements but not for force
               generation. While both neocortical and cerebellar activity
               increased with increasing speed and force, the speed-related
               changes in the cerebellum were larger than predicted by an
               optimized cortico-cerebellar connectivity model. We then applied
               the same approach in a cognitive domain, assessing how the
               cerebellum supports working memory. Enhanced gating was
               associated with the encoding of items in working memory, but not
               with the manipulation or retrieval of the items. Focusing on
               task-dependent gating of neocortical inputs to the cerebellum
               offers a promising approach for using fMRI to understand the

              was exposed in anesthetized rats, and the site was superfused with
              Ringer. Field potentials were recorded, and BFcrb was measured by
              laser-Doppler flowmetry. Crus II was activated by electrical

              and increased BFcrb (34 +/- 6\%; 10 Hz-25 V; n = 6) without
              changing arterial pressure. The BFcrb increases were associated
              with a local increase in glucose utilization (74 +/- 8\%; P <

              virtually abolished the increases in BFcrb (-90 +/- 2\%; P < 0.01)
              but did not affect the amplitude of the field potentials. In

              BFcrb that are mediated by activation of glutamate receptors and

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The mechanisms regulating the cerebellar
              microcirculation during neural activity are poorly understood. One
              of the major neural inputs to the cerebellar cortex is the
              climbing fiber (CF), a pathway that uses excitatory amino acids,
              including glutamate, as a transmitter. We studied whether CF
              activation increases cerebellar blood flow (BFcrb) and, if so, we
              investigated the role of glutamate receptors, nitric oxide (NO)
              and cGMP, in the response. METHODS: The CF were activated by
              harmaline administration (40 mg/kg, i.p.) in
              halothane-anesthetized rats with a cranial window placed over the
              cerebellar vermis. BFcrb was monitored by a laser-Doppler probe,
              and arterial pressure and blood gases were controlled. RESULTS:
              With Ringer superfusion, harmaline produced sustained increases in
              BFcrb that peaked 20 minutes after administration (+115 +/- 13\%;
              n=6; P.05; n=5). The response was attenuated by the nonselective
              NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor nitro-L-arginine (1 mmol/L; -73 +/-
              5\%; n=6) or by 7-NI (50 mg, i.p.; -71 +/- 5\%; n=5), a relatively
              selective neuronal NOS inhibitor. The soluble guanylyl cyclase
              inhibitor 1H-1,2,4oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (100
              micromol/L) attenuated the response to harmaline (-73 +/- 5; P.05;
              n=5) or 8-bromo-cGMP (P>.05; n=5). CONCLUSIONS: Activation of the
              CF system increases BFcrb. The response depends on activation of
              glutamate receptors and is in large part mediated by NO via
              stimulation of soluble guanylyl cyclase. Glutamate receptors NO
              and cGMP are important factors in the mechanisms of functional
              hyperemia in cerebellar cortex.",

              flow produced by synaptic activity using the parallel fiber (PF)
              system of the cerebellum as a model. The midline cerebellum was
              exposed in anesthetized rats and the PFs were stimulated with
              tungsten microelectrodes. Cerebellar blood flow (BFcrb) was
              recorded using a laser-Doppler probe, whereas field potentials
              were recorded using glass micropipettes. PF stimulation produced
              increases in BFcrb that were related to the frequency and
              intensity of stimulation (+60 +/- 9\%, mean +/- SE, at 100 microA
              and 30 Hz; n = 6). The greatest increases were confined to a band
              stretching along the major axis of the stimulated folium and
              corresponding to the beam of activated PFs. The increase in evoked
              by PF stimulation was associated with a corresponding increase in
              glucose utilization, assessed by the 2-deoxyglucose method. The
              increases in BFcrb and the field potentials evoked by PF
              stimulation were abolished by tetrodotoxin (1 microM; n = 6).
              Ringer solution containing 12 mM Mg2+ and 0 mM Ca2+ blocked
              synaptic activity in the PFs and abolished the increases in flow
              (P > 0.05 from baseline; n = 5). The broad-spectrum glutamate
              receptor antagonist kynurenate (5 mM) prevented depolarization of
              Purkinje cells and interneurons and abolished the increase in
              BFcrb evoked by PF stimulation (P > 0.05; n = 6). Treatment with
              tetrodotoxin, Mg2+, or kynurenate did not affect the increase in
              BFcrb elicited by systemic hypercapnia or by topical application
              of the nitric oxide donor 3-morpholino sydnonimine (P > 0.05 from
              Ringer solution). We conclude that the increases in flow produced
              by synaptic activity are linked to glutamate-induced
              depolarization of Purkinje cells and interneurons. These findings
              provide evidence that activation of glutamate receptors
              participates in the mechanisms of functional hyperemia, and they
              support the validity of the PF system as a model for study of the
              relationship between synaptic activity and blood flow in the CNS.",

              nonselective NOS inhibitor N-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA, 1 mM)
              reduced resting BFcrb and attenuated the response to PF
              stimulation (-47 +/- 5\%) and hypercapnia (-46 +/- 7\%; PCO2 =
              50-60 mmHg). After L-NNA, superfusion with the NO donors
              3-morpholinosydnonimine (100 microM, n = 5) or
              S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine (5 microM, n = 5) reestablished
              resting BFcrb (P > 0.05 vs. before L-NNA) and reversed
              L-NNA-induced attenuation of the response to hypercapnia (P > 0.05
              vs. before L-NNA) but not PF stimulation (P > 0.05 vs. after
              L-NNA). Similar results were obtained when NOS activity was
              inhibited with the inhibitor of neuronal NOS 7-nitroindazole (50
              mg/kg i.p.). Like NO donors, the guanosine 3',5'-cyclic
              monophosphate analog 8-bromoguanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate
              (n = 5), administered after L-NNA, restored resting BFcrb and
              counteracted inhibition of the response to hypercapnia but not PF
              stimulation. In contrast to NO donors and 8-bromoguanosine
              3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, the NO-independent vasodilator
              papaverine (100 microM, n = 5) had no effect on attenuation of
              responses to PF stimulation or hypercapnia. Thus NO donors are
              unable to reverse the effect of NOS inhibition on vasodilation
              produced by PF stimulation. The data support the hypothesis that
              the vascular response to PF stimulation, at variance with
              hypercapnia, requires NOS activation and NO production. Thus NO
              plays an obligatory role in vasodilation produced by increased
              functional activity in cerebellar cortex.",

               effect used in functional MRI (fMRI), the relationship between
               NVC and NA is still unclear. Since recent studies reported
               cerebellar non-linearities in BOLD signals during motor tasks
               execution, we investigated the NVC/NA relationship using a range
               of input frequencies in acute mouse cerebellar slices of vermis
               and hemisphere. The capillary diameter increased in response to
               mossy fiber activation in the 6-300 Hz range, with a marked
               inflection around 50 Hz (vermis) and 100 Hz (hemisphere). The

              activity controls blood vessel diameter. In the cerebellum, the
              molecular layer is regarded as the main NVC determinant. However,
              the granular layer is a region with variable metabolic demand
              caused by large activity fluctuations that shows a prominent
              expression of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) and nitric oxide synthase
              (NOS) and is therefore much more suitable for effective NVC. Here,
              we show, in the granular layer of acute rat cerebellar slices,
              that capillary diameter changes rapidly after mossy fiber
              stimulation. Vasodilation required neuronal NMDARs and NOS
              stimulation and subsequent guanylyl cyclase activation that
              probably occurred in pericytes. Vasoconstriction required
              metabotropic glutamate receptors and CYP ω-hydroxylase, the enzyme
              regulating 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid production. Therefore,

              given the emerging role played by this brain structure, not only
              in motor behavior, but also in cognitive functions. Although
              previous studies focused on the molecular layer, here, we shift
              attention onto the mossy fiber granule cell (GrC) relay. We
              demonstrate that GrC activity causes a robust vasodilation in
              nearby capillaries via the NMDA receptors-neuronal nitric oxide
              synthase signaling pathway. At the same time, metabotropic
              glutamate receptors mediate 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic
              acid-dependent vasoconstriction. These results reveal a complex
              signaling network that hints for the first time at the granular

              properties by focusing on short-term variability and its
              dependence on behavioral state. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:
              Using an analysis based on CV(2) values, we could isolate precise
              regular spiking patterns, lasting up to hundreds of milliseconds,
              in PC simple spike trains recorded in both anesthetized and awake
              rodents. Regular spike patterns, defined by low variability of
              successive ISIs, comprised over half of the spikes, showed a wide
              range of mean ISIs, and were affected by behavioral state and
              tactile stimulation. Interestingly, regular patterns often
              coincided in nearby Purkinje cells without precise synchronization
              of individual spikes. Regular patterns exclusively appeared during
              the up state of the PC membrane potential, while single ISIs
              occurred both during up and down states. Possible functional
              consequences of regular spike patterns were investigated by
              modeling the synaptic conductance in neurons of the deep
              cerebellar nuclei (DCN). Simulations showed that these regular
              patterns caused epochs of relatively constant synaptic conductance
              in DCN neurons. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings indicate
              that the apparent irregularity in cerebellar PC simple spike
              trains in vivo is most likely caused by mixing of different
              regular spike patterns, separated by single long intervals, over
              time. We propose that PCs may signal information, at least in
              part, in regular spike patterns to downstream DCN neurons.",

               interaction between simple spike (SS) and complex spike (CS)
               discharge, the two fundamentally different activity modalities of
               Purkinje cells. Although several hypotheses have provided
               insights into the interaction, none fully explains or is
               completely consistent with the spectrum of experimental
               observations. Here, we show that during a pseudo-random manual
               tracking task in the monkey (Macaca mulatta), climbing fiber
               discharge dynamically controls the information present in the SS
               firing, triggering robust and rapid changes in the SS encoding of
               motor signals in 67\% of Purkinje cells. The changes in encoding,
               tightly coupled to CS occurrences, consist of either increases or
               decreases in the SS sensitivity to kinematics or position errors
               and are not due to differences in SS firing rates or variability.
               Nor are the changes in sensitivity due to CS rhythmicity. In
               addition, the CS-coupled changes in encoding are not evoked by
               changes in kinematics or position errors. Instead, CS discharge
               most often leads alterations in behavior. Increases in SS
               encoding of a kinematic parameter are associated with larger
               changes in that parameter than are decreases in SS encoding.
               Increases in SS encoding of position error are followed by and
               scale with decreases in error. The results suggest a novel
               function of CSs, in which climbing fiber input dynamically
               controls the state of Purkinje cell SS encoding in advance of
               changes in behavior.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Purkinje cells, the
               sole output of the cerebellar cortex, manifest two fundamentally
               different activity modalities, complex spike (CS) discharge and
               simple spike (SS) firing. Elucidating cerebellar function will
               require an understanding of the interactions, both short- and
               long-term, between CS and SS firing. This study shows that CSs
               dynamically control the information encoded in a Purkinje cell's
               SS activity by rapidly increasing or decreasing the SS
               sensitivity to kinematics and/or performance errors independent
               of firing rate. In many cases, the CS-coupled shift in SS
               encoding leads a change in behavior. These novel findings on the
               interaction between CS and SS firing provide for a new hypothesis
               in which climbing fiber input adjusts the encoding of SS
               information in advance of a change in behavior.",
