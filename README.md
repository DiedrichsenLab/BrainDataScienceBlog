# BrainDataScienceBlog
This is a repository with the code and raw materials to build the [*Brain, Data, and Science*](http://diedrichsenlab.org/BrainDataScience) Blog. It is heavily build on the [Tufte.css](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/) and the [markdown library](https://python-markdown.github.io/).

## Automatic GH-pages deployment

### Step-0 Fork this repository â‘‚

### Step-1 Create a GitHub access token ðŸ”‘ 

Please follow [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-token) to create an access token. While creating the token, you will only click the `repository` checkbox. 

### Step-2 Create an encrypted secret for your repo ðŸ˜Ž

Simply follow [these steps](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) to create a **repository secret named `PAT_BLOG`**.

### Step-3 That's it! 

If a secret is added successfully, a webpage build will be run by GitHub actions automatically and the webpage will be published online at: `your_gh_user_name.github.io/BrainDataScienceBlog` (unless you change the repository name). 

You can test the build by simply changing the README file (remove the last line etc.). When you add more content following the [writing a new blog section](#writing-a-new-blog), those pages will be built automatically and added to your webpage! 

## Local Installation 

Fork or clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/DiedrichsenLab/BrainDataScienceBlog).

The repro required `python v >= 3.6`. You also need to have the following dependencies installed: 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Building the webpage manually

A single Markdown file can be compiled to the target (`_build`) directory using: 

`python3 ./code/build.py`

If the build succeeds, you can see the webpage by opening `_build/index.htm` in your web browser.

## Writing a new blog

Each blog has its own directory in the repository. The directory name serves as the id for the blog. The code builds and includes all the blogs that are listed in `list.yaml`. 

All blogs must have the following files:

* `icon.png`: a square icon for the blog (ideally 150x150px)
* `info.yaml`: Basic information about the blog 
* `text.md`: Markdown file with text
* `references.bib`: Optional bibtex file with references - insert a blank file if you don't use citations. 

Blogs are written in plain markdown `.md` language. I like to use the free editor [Typora](https://typora.io/) which is a clean wysiwyg editor for markdown that also sets formulas correctly. Besides the standard markdown, we are using the following tags as markdown extensions:  

`<p>,<div>,<...>`: Any block-level html tag will be untouched and included as is. 

`{+side:text}`: Adds a numbered side note. 

`{+margin:text}`: Adds a margin note without a number. 

`{{text}}`: Formats text in Small Caps - you can highlight new thoughts at the beginning of a paragraph like this. 

 `[+citep:bibtex-id]` and `[+citet:bibtex-id]`: Citation to a reference in the `references.bib` file. 

`![alt title:filename] Caption`: Block-level tag (separate from rest by blank lines) that includes a Figure. 

For more information about formating options, see this [example blog](http://www.diedrichsenlab.org/BrainDataScience/example_blog/index.htm).
