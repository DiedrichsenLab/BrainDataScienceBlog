# Example blog
Brain, Data, and Science is a blog by the diedrichsen lab on brain science, data science, and well - science in general. Instead of using wordpress or other platforms, we decided that we wanted full control over the formating to play creatively with a new way of communicating science. Inspired by Edward Tufte's work, we set up a automatic platform that fixedly compiles blogs written in markdown language into a web-blog that uses format to facilitate insight.

## Getting started
To contribute blogs or responses to Brain, Data, and Science, fork the repository. Each blog has it's own folder.

## Fundamentals
### Side notes and references
Side note are a specific feature of the Tufte style.
When you have a comment or refenence {+side: then you can use a side note}. If you have reference, you can cite it like so {+ref: Diedrichsen2002}.

### Formulas
Math type setting is of course very important to use. Math is dealt with by mathjax .....

### Code
Code come in code blocks or inline code

## Acknowledgements
The basic formating is based from Tufte-LaTeX and and the GitHub project tufte-css. The blog is based on Markdown....Indepe
