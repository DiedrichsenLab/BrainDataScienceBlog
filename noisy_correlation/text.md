This question Problem...
Of course we can 

## Is there a problem? 
Well, not if you just want to show that the random vectos )


## Solution 1: Correcting for noise by using cross-block covariances (or split-half correlations)


## Solution 2: Using a Bayesian approach (Pattern Component Modelling) 


## How to deal with more complex situations
